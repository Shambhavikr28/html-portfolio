<h1>About Me </h1>
<p> Hi everyone! My name is Shambhavi Kumar. I am a student at Indian Institue of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, India.</p>
<p>For my education background, I have completed my schooling from Bal Bharati Public School, Dwarka, New Delhi. I scored 95.4% in 10th Boards and 90% in 12th Boards. Then through some hard work and mostly luck I got into IIT(ISM),Dhanbad to do mu B.Tech with the specialization in Mining Engineering. Currently, I have a cumulative grade(cg) of 8.18. </p>
<p>As of for my personal background, I was born in Chandigarh, a marvellous and classy place in India and then brought up in Delhi, the capital of India. I have a younger sibling who is two years younger to me and completely useless if you ask me about it. My parents, both were from Bihar and they shifted here for my dad's job, he is a CA and my mom is a home-maker. </p>
<p>This is all I can think for now, maybe letter if I feel like improving it, I will. I know it looks very informal for now but this is the best I can come up with within like 2 minutes of time that was given to me. </p>
<p>Till then bbye :)</p>
